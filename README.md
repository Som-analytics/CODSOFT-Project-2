📈 Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is part of my CodSoft Data Science Internship tasks.
The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict product sales based on advertisement spending on different media platforms.

📁 Dataset Used
- Source: advertising.csv

Contains features such as:
- TV, Radio, Newspaper

Target variable: Sales (numeric)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

✅ Workflow
- Importing libraries and loading dataset
- Data exploration (info(), describe(), correlation heatmap)
- Data visualization using scatter plots
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Building a Linear Regression model

Evaluating the model using:
MAE, MSE, RMSE
R² Score

Visualizing actual vs predicted sales

📊 Output
- Intercept and coefficients of the model
- Evaluation metrics printed
- Bar chart comparing actual vs predicted sales
